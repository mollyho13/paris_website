      <h2>Molly est ici!</h2>
      <p>This is my slice of life in Paris — a creative mix of journal entries, adventures, photography, videos, and random ideas. I am making this as a scrapbook/journal for my time in Paris. 2 months is a long time in a new city, and I hope this provides you with a snapshot of my life (the good and the bad) here. Follow along for fun ✌️</p>

      <h2>Currently (Updated: July 25, 2025)</h2>
      <p> It is my last week in Paris as I am writing this, and it has been such a wonderful experience. I definitely fell in love with this city while being here for 2 months. I desperately hope to come back and live here again. If anything, this program and experience has taught me that I am capable of living away from home and that the world has so much to offer. I am going to miss my friends who don't go to Cal but I will forever cherish the time I've had here.</p>

      <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
      <p> I wanted to build a website for my final project because it is what I have been doing for my internship here. Not directly this website, but coding tools and interfaces for my company. Originally, I had a lot of knowledge but not much implementation practice. Here, you'll find a creative snapshot of the technical skills I've gained, along with thoughts and updates about my time in Paris.</p>
      <p> I added a lot of cool features like writing blog posts, uploading pictures, and making moodboards on here, however do not expect them to continuously update the site. I would have had to spend more time develpping and deploying a database, which costs money and time I simply did not have (they do work though!).
        Additionally, it is normal to have some lag when loading each page (again I am using free resources and coded this from scratch so it affects the efficiency of each section)
      </p>
      <p>Have a look around the site and hope you can catch a glimpse inside my life and thoughts!</p>
