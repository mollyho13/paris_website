      <h2>Three Weeks into My Paris Adventure</h2>
      <div class="post-excerpt">
        <p>I can't believe it's already been three weeks since I arrived in Paris for my summer internship. The city has this incredible way of surprising you daily – yesterday I discovered the most amazing little bookshop café in Belleville, and today I finally mastered the art of ordering coffee without awkwardly switching to English halfway through...</p>
      </div>
      <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>The learning curve has been steep but so rewarding. My French is improving daily (though I still panic-order the same croissant every morning because I know I can pronounce it correctly). The startup I'm working with has this incredible energy – everyone's so passionate about what they're building, and they've been incredibly patient with my questions and language mistakes.</p>
        
        <p>Yesterday's bookshop discovery in Belleville was pure magic. It's called "Des Livres et des Rêves" and it's this tiny place where books are stacked floor to ceiling, and they serve the most perfect café au lait in mismatched vintage cups. I ended up staying for three hours, alternating between reading a French novel (very slowly) and watching Parisians drift in and out.</p>
        
        <p>The metro is becoming my second home. I've learned that 8:30 AM is absolute chaos, but 7:45 AM is perfect. I've also mastered the art of looking busy so no one tries to sell me anything, and I've memorized which car to get on at République to be closest to the exit at my stop.</p>
        
        <p>Some random observations that I want to remember:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Parisians really do carry fresh baguettes under their arms like it's completely normal</li>
          <li>Everyone dresses like they're going somewhere important, even to buy groceries</li>
          <li>The golden hour light hits different here – it's like Instagram filter but real</li>
          <li>My neighbors say "bonjour" every time we pass in the hallway and I love it</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Three weeks down, many more to go. I'm starting to feel less like a tourist and more like someone who belongs here, even if temporarily. C'est incroyable how quickly a place can start to feel like home when you're open to it.</p>

        <h4>Learning React at a French Startup</h4>
        <div class="post-excerpt">
          <p>Working in a different language (both coding and spoken!) has been such an interesting challenge. My teammates are incredibly patient with my franglais, and I'm picking up so much about European tech culture...</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
          <p>The codebase here is fascinating – everything is commented in French, which means I'm learning technical vocabulary I never knew I needed. "fonction" instead of "function," "boucle" instead of "loop." It's like learning to code all over again, but in the most charming way possible.</p>
          
          <p>My team lead, Marie, has been incredible. She switches between French and English depending on what I need, and she's teaching me not just React patterns but also how French developers approach problems differently than what I learned in school.</p>
          
          <p>The startup culture here feels more... sustainable? Less of that "grind until you burn out" mentality and more focus on crafting good code and taking proper lunch breaks. Speaking of which, lunch breaks are sacred here – we actually leave the office and sit in the park nearby. Revolutionary concept!</p>
          
          <p>I'm working on a user dashboard component that needs to handle real-time data, and debugging in French is... an adventure. But I'm getting better at reading error messages and asking the right questions. Plus, I've learned that "ça marche pas" is the universal French equivalent of "it's not working" in any language.</p>

        <h4>Croissant Chronicles: Rating Every Boulangerie Near My Apartment</h4>
        <div class="post-excerpt">
          <p>I've made it my mission to try every bakery within a 10-minute walk of my place. Here's my very scientific ranking system based on flakiness, butter content, and whether they smile when I butcher the pronunciation...</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
          <p><strong>The Scientific Method (aka my very important criteria):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Flakiness Factor:</strong> Does it leave a beautiful mess on my plate?</li>
            <li><strong>Butter Situation:</strong> Can I taste the French countryside?</li>
            <li><strong>Kindness Level:</strong> Do they pretend my pronunciation is acceptable?</li>
            <li><strong>Morning Reliability:</strong> Are they consistent at 7 AM?</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>The Rankings:</strong></p>
          
          <p><strong>🥇 Boulangerie Laurent (Rue de la Fontaine au Roi):</strong> Absolute perfection. The croissants are so flaky they should come with a warning. The old man behind the counter has started recognizing me and now just nods when I walk in. This is acceptance. 9.5/10</p>
          
          <p><strong>🥈 Maison Kayser (Place de la République):</strong> Reliable, gorgeous, probably too fancy for my daily habit but I can't resist. The morning rush is intense but worth it. 8.5/10</p>
          
          <p><strong>🥉 Du Pain et Des Idées (Rue Yves Toudic):</strong> A bit of a walk but their lamination game is unreal. I go here on weekends when I have time to savor properly. 8/10</p>
          
          <p><strong>La Parisienne (Rue de Bretagne):</strong> Cute and close, but inconsistent. Sometimes amazing, sometimes just... bread shaped like a croissant. 6.5/10</p>
          
          <p>Current daily routine: Boulangerie Laurent on weekdays, Du Pain et Des Idées on Saturday mornings when I want to feel fancy. This is important research for my overall Paris experience, obviously.</p>

        <h4>Getting Lost in the 20th: An Accidental Discovery</h4>
        <div class="post-excerpt">
          <p>Took the wrong metro exit and ended up in this incredible neighborhood I'd never heard of. Sometimes the best adventures happen when you have no idea where you're going...</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
          <p>So apparently I've been taking the wrong exit at Belleville for three weeks. Today I was running late and in my hurry, I took a different staircase and emerged into what felt like a completely different city.</p>
          
          <p>The 20th arrondissement is this beautiful mix of street art, little markets, and the most incredible views over the city. I found myself on Rue Dénoyez, which is basically an outdoor art gallery. Every wall tells a story, and the colors are so vibrant they make the gray Parisian buildings look intentional.</p>
          
          <p>I stumbled into Parc de Belleville completely by accident while trying to find my way back to familiar territory. The view from the top is insane – you can see all of Paris spread out below, and suddenly all those metro maps make sense. The Eiffel Tower looks tiny from up there, which puts everything in perspective.</p>
          
          <p>There was this little café called "Le Baratin" where I stopped for directions and ended up staying for lunch. The owner spoke no English, I spoke terrible French, but somehow we had an entire conversation about Paris neighborhoods and she drew me a little map on a napkin showing all the "secret" spots tourists never find.</p>
          
          <p>I'm definitely coming back here on weekends. It feels more authentic somehow – like regular Parisians living their lives instead of the more polished areas I've been sticking to. Getting lost was the best mistake I've made so far.</p>
          
          <p>Mental note: wrong metro exits = best discoveries. Take the scenic route more often.</p>

        <h4>Week One Thoughts: Culture Shock and Croissants</h4>
        <div class="post-excerpt">
          <p>First week in Paris is complete! Sharing all my initial observations, from the metro etiquette I'm still learning to the way Parisians make even grocery shopping look effortlessly chic...</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
          <p>Week one is officially in the books, and my brain is still processing everything. Paris is exactly what I expected and nothing like I imagined, all at the same time.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Things I'm still figuring out:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Metro etiquette (apparently standing on the right side of escalators is SERIOUS business)</li>
            <li>When to say "bonjour" vs "bonsoir" (I switched too early yesterday and got a look)</li>
            <li>How long to wait in line for coffee (answer: however long it takes, rushing is not a thing)</li>
            <li>Whether my apartment building has a secret code for everything (spoiler: it does)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Things that blow my mind daily:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The bread situation – fresh baguettes twice a day is apparently normal?</li>
            <li>How everyone looks put-together even at 7 AM</li>
            <li>The way light hits the Haussmanian buildings in the evening</li>
            <li>That my local grocery store has a cheese section bigger than most American whole stores</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The internship starts Monday and I'm nervous-excited. Working in tech here is going to be so different from what I'm used to. But if this week taught me anything, it's that being slightly out of my depth is exactly where I need to be right now.</p>
          
          <p>Also, I've eaten croissants five days in a row and I regret nothing.</p>

        <h4>Bonjour, Paris! The Adventure Begins</h4>
        <div class="post-excerpt">
          <p>Just landed in Charles de Gaulle with two overpacked suitcases and a heart full of excitement. This is it – my summer in Paris starts now. Here's to new beginnings, incredible experiences, and hopefully not too many embarrassing language mistakes...</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
          <p>I'm writing this from my tiny apartment in the 11th arrondissement, still a bit jet-lagged but too excited to sleep. The flight felt like forever, but the moment I saw Paris from the plane window, everything became real.</p>
          
          <p>Charles de Gaulle airport was... an adventure. My French apparently needs more work than I thought, and I definitely got on the wrong RER train initially. But I made it! The metro system is incredible once you figure it out (still working on that part).</p>
          
          <p>My apartment is smaller than my dorm room but has these amazing floor-to-ceiling windows and a tiny balcony that overlooks a courtyard. The previous tenant left a note in broken English welcoming me and explaining how to work the temperamental shower. Parisians are already being kinder than I expected.</p>
          
          <p>First mission tomorrow: find the nearest boulangerie, figure out how to order coffee without looking like a complete tourist, and locate the startup office where I'll be spending my summer. The internship doesn't start until Monday, so I have a few days to get my bearings and hopefully overcome this intimidation factor.</p>
          
          <p>I keep pinching myself that this is actually happening. Three months in Paris, working at a tech startup, having the kind of experience I've been dreaming about since I decided to study abroad. The nerves are real, but so is the excitement.</p>
          
          <p>À bientôt, internet. This is going to be incredible.</p>
