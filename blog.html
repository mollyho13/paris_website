      <h2>Three Weeks into My Euro (Working) Girl Summer </h2>
      <div class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Paris has been wild so far. I started creating this website this week so I can journal about my time here...</p>
      </div>
      <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>The learning curve has been steep, and honestly scary. I am trying hard to speak only French but people keep responding in English
          so I'm unsure whether to resort to comfort and speak English or continue in French. I am looking forward to going to Bordeaux this weekend with the program
          I was debating about studying abroad there in my Junior Spring, but decided against it. This weekend I'm hoping to enjoy the sights and the vibes there.
        </p>
        
        <p>Three weeks down, many more to go.</p>

          <p> My friend since 7th grade is coincidentally in Paris for two weeks doing a school summer program. So we couldn't forget to do our 7 year old tradition...</p>
          <p>Every end of the school year and start of the school year, me and my friend Felicity get together and make Japanese candies. Like the powder and water things you mix together to make little candy meals. Despite growing apart (amicably) throughout high school,
            we always make time to meet up with each other once at the beginning and end of summer to do our little tradition. This time its #European! We made little gummy pizzas in the Tuileries while I was on my lunch break. Contrary to popular belief, we never eat the candy because it is absolutley nasty.
            I cherish our friendship so much because even though we don't talk everyday, we still love one another and know that our friendship is still very strong.

        <h4>5 Nights of ... Fun!</h4>
        <div class="post-excerpt">
          <p>Not only was this weekend to celebrate France, but also my 2 friends I met in the program! They both turned 21, so of course, as any American does, we celebrated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
          <p>Not only was this weekend to celebrate France, but also my 2 friends I met in the program! They both turned 21, so of course, as any American does, we celebrated.
            We celebrated one friend on Friday and Saturday and then went to the Bals de Pompiers on Sunday to celebrate my other friend. Monday I went on a date with a Parisian (!!) to watch the fireworks since surprisingly neither of us have seen them before.
            Finally, on Tuesday, we ended the extravaganza by going to the Kendrick Lamar and Sza concert where we were on the floor.
          </p>          
          <p>Overall, I am not too big on going out and whenever I do, I get sleepy and typically am one of the first ones to retire for the night. However, I stuck it out for my friends. Bals de Pompiers was especially fun because all the firehouses threw fun parties.
            It's nice to be at a well controlled party instead a frat one tbh. We did lose (but ultimately find) some of our friends---so it was an adventure to say the least.
          </p>
          <p> The Kendrick and Sza concert was everything I could have asked for. I was scared because I bought resell tickets for a low price that I thought they were fake, but apparently France just has better ticket prices because why were they 5x less than floor at their concert in the US
            Anyways, because I'm short, I already resigned myself to not seeing them on stage, but I was SOO short i could not even see the big screen behind the tallest people ever. But I was vibing still to the music. After the concert, me and my friend went to McDonalds to close out the night in American fashion.
          </p>          
          <p> I'm super tired from going out 5 days in a row and I feel like I need 2 weeks of silence to recover. But work is calling me of course.</p>

        <h4>Loneliness be Hitting</h4>
        <div class="post-excerpt">
          <p>Working in a different language (both coding and spoken!) has been such an interesting challenge. My teammates are incredibly patient with my franglais, and I'm picking up so much about European tech culture...</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
          <p>The codebase here is fascinating – everything is commented in French, which means I'm learning technical vocabulary I never knew I needed. "fonction" instead of "function," "boucle" instead of "loop." It's like learning to code all over again, but in the most charming way possible.</p>
          
          <p>My team lead, Marie, has been incredible. She switches between French and English depending on what I need, and she's teaching me not just React patterns but also how French developers approach problems differently than what I learned in school.</p>
          
          <p>The startup culture here feels more... sustainable? Less of that "grind until you burn out" mentality and more focus on crafting good code and taking proper lunch breaks. Speaking of which, lunch breaks are sacred here – we actually leave the office and sit in the park nearby. Revolutionary concept!</p>
          
          <p>I'm working on a user dashboard component that needs to handle real-time data, and debugging in French is... an adventure. But I'm getting better at reading error messages and asking the right questions. Plus, I've learned that "ça marche pas" is the universal French equivalent of "it's not working" in any language.</p>
