      <h2>Three Weeks into My Euro (Working) Girl Summer </h2>
      <div class="post-excerpt">
        <p>Paris has been wild so far. I started creating this website this week so I can journal about my time here...</p>
      </div>
      <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>The learning curve has been steep, and honestly scary. I am trying hard to speak only French but people keep responding in English
          so I'm unsure whether to resort to comfort and speak English or continue in French. I am looking forward to going to Bordeaux this weekend with the program
          I was debating about studying abroad there in my Junior Spring, but decided against it. This weekend I'm hoping to enjoy the sights and the vibes there.
        </p>
        
        <p>Three weeks down, many more to go.</p>

        <h4>7 years of Candy Making</h4>

          <p> My friend since 7th grade is coincidentally in Paris for two weeks doing a school summer program. So we couldn't forget to do our 7 year old tradition...</p>
          <p>Every end of the school year and start of the school year, me and my friend Felicity get together and make Japanese candies. Like the powder and water things you mix together to make little candy meals. Despite growing apart (amicably) throughout high school,
            we always make time to meet up with each other once at the beginning and end of summer to do our little tradition. This time its #European! We made little gummy pizzas in the Tuileries while I was on my lunch break. Contrary to popular belief, we never eat the candy because it is absolutley nasty.
            I cherish our friendship so much because even though we don't talk everyday, we still love one another and know that our friendship is still very strong.

        <h4>5 Nights of ... Fun!</h4>
        <div class="post-excerpt">
          <p>Not only was this weekend to celebrate France, but also my 2 friends I met in the program! They both turned 21, so of course, as any American does, we celebrated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
          <p>Not only was this weekend to celebrate France, but also my 2 friends I met in the program! They both turned 21, so of course, as any American does, we celebrated.
            We celebrated one friend on Friday and Saturday and then went to the Bals de Pompiers on Sunday to celebrate my other friend. Monday I went on a date with a Parisian (!!) to watch the fireworks since surprisingly neither of us have seen them before.
            Finally, on Tuesday, we ended the extravaganza by going to the Kendrick Lamar and Sza concert where we were on the floor.
          </p>          
          <p>Overall, I am not too big on going out and whenever I do, I get sleepy and typically am one of the first ones to retire for the night. However, I stuck it out for my friends. Bals de Pompiers was especially fun because all the firehouses threw fun parties.
            It's nice to be at a well controlled party instead a frat one tbh. We did lose (but ultimately find) some of our friends---so it was an adventure to say the least.
          </p>
          <p> The Kendrick and Sza concert was everything I could have asked for. I was scared because I bought resell tickets for a low price that I thought they were fake, but apparently France just has better ticket prices because why were they 5x less than floor at their concert in the US
            Anyways, because I'm short, I already resigned myself to not seeing them on stage, but I was SOO short i could not even see the big screen behind the tallest people ever. But I was vibing still to the music. After the concert, me and my friend went to McDonalds to close out the night in American fashion.
          </p>          
          <p> I'm super tired from going out 5 days in a row and I feel like I need 2 weeks of silence to recover. But work is calling me of course.</p>

        <h4>Loneliness be Hitting</h4>

          <p>Not gonna lie fam, but I've been cooked! All is well, except my urge to solo quest has recently been trumped by my anxiety. To be honest, I may be getting a little homesick, but I 
            am struggling to leave the room after work. I still go out, but sometimes on the weekends all I do is sleep for 14 hours a day and not leave my bed. Sometimes even going grocery shopping is hard.
            I struggle with depression, and I really hoped that being in a new environment would motivate me to go out, but alas... I can't escape it some days. I still regularly see my friends and talk to my family back home 
            but it's been getting harder and harder to push myself. Hopefully this is just a small bump--I do really like Paris.

          <p>Working in a different language (both coding and spoken) has been such an interesting challenge, but my boss is chill. At work, my coworker and I have been working on any and all things our boss assigns to us. I was working on some automation tools for them, which was very fun for me because I like to code and it was actually useful. Now I'm working on some 
            market research which I do not have a strong passion for like coding, but is still a nice skill to have.
          </p>
          <p> The culture in the office is okay, because it is mostly a coworking space. At least I figured out how to make free iced coffee. Overall, it's just like I am studying for 7 hours a day at Moffitt, so while not too demanding, I definitely wish I could explore Paris more.</p>

        <h4>42.0 hours in Amsterdam</h4>
        <div class="post-excerpt">
          <p>Chat. It was epic. My solo adventure became a 3 person extravaganza, and it was the best time of my life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>I casually mentioned to some friends in the program that I was going to Amsterdam for travel and lodging all under $200, and immediately 2 people wanted to join me. We were only there for one night, but it was a perfect amount. My friend Payton and I went on an earlier train and shopped around the city for a bit.
          We walked and talked and ate some amazing food. Of course there were coffeeshops around there but we didn't visit them (..yet) I saw the most wonderful vintage designer bag and it took everything in me not to get it.
        </p>
        <p>I hadn't gotten much time to talk to Payton beforehand but she is literally the nicest person ever. I always get a bit of social anxiety when talking to people one-on-one but she was so genuine and cool. Later we went on a canal tour because one must in Amsterdam. After that she found a lovely waterfront dinner that 
          we lowkey had trouble finding but ended up being delicious in the end. We then made our way to Utrecht because I initially booked my hostel there since I wanted to visit the university. omg and there was so much Miffy there. It's where the silly little bunny was
          originated and they even had a Miffy spotlight. We got drinks and the hostel was very nice while we waited for our other friend Evelyn to arrive. The minute she arrived we went full-on Amsterdam hehehe.
        </p>
        <p> Sleep is for the weak, so we got up at 7:30 am and made our way back to Amsterdam to make it for our lil bike tour of the city (typical Amsterdam fashion). We barely made it in time for the tour and we were the only Americans 
          but the tour guide was nice and funny. After, our guide recommended us to go to the World's Largest Flea Market, with over 750 stalls. It was heaven and I got so so many knick knacks. They even had flip phones, but not the ferrari one I want :/
          We made it back for our train and arrived right back home where I immediately turned around and went out lol to visit my friend Felicity who is here for a few weeks.

        <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
          <p>The title speaks for itself. Not much to share about it other than it was amazing. It is this little hole in the wall in Montmartre that only serves fondue and wine from baby bottles. Some people even had to climb over the table to sit in their seat.
            It was filled with writing from customers on the walls, chairs, tables, you name it. Of course we put a little mark on the wall :D We also struck up a really nice and fun conversation 
            with some parents who were sitting next to us while their kids were at a different table. Safe to say we WILL be back.

        <h4>Solo Questing</h4>

        <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
          <p>As lovely as my bed is, I must defy all urges to sleep to explore this wonderful city. My biggest goal from this experience was trying to become more okay with going on solo trips. I am planning on going to Amsterdam and Utrecht next weekend as a little solo adventure plus seeing where I will be studying abroad in the Spring (Utrecht University)
            Other than this upcoming trip, I have been going to see some movies by myself and just walking around Paris. I have a bit of social anxiety to actually get up and go do something, but I am setting intentions once a week to go out and explore at least once by myself.
            So far, I visited Musee d'Orsay and saw the Impressionist paintings. I have also been galavanting around the Champs Elysée after work and frolicking about in the Marais.
          </p>
          <p> I have saved so many restaurants and exhibits and coffee shops and flea markets and everything in between, so hopefully I will not be deterred from going out and exploring. My big goal is to visit the Cinemathèque Française and going to their special Wes Anderson Exhibit.</p>

        <h4>Baby's First Fête de la Musique and Pride</h4>
        <div class="post-excerpt">
          <p>There's a first time for everything!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>There's a first time for everything! While not in Paris, Bordeaux had a fun Fête de la Musique. It was centered mostly in downtown Bordeaux so we could definitely leave if we got overstimulated. That said, the alleyways were small so it seemed a lot more packed than I think it was. Me and my roommate from the program Evelyn went out on the town 
          and we had a blast. We caught our eyes on the first outdoor beer booth and immediately chugged down a pint. It made me queasy for a bit but my stomach is always upset (more on this later). Anyways, we were dancing around town, so two marching bands, and sooo many high schoolers off their butts.
          After a bit of crowdwork (navigating through gridlock) we sat down an watched with everyone at the restaurant the Bordeaux v. Marseille rugby match. Holy cow that was brutal. I don't fully understand the culture of knocking people down for balls but oh well... it was a fun environment.
          Then we engaged in some deep talk and gossip over drinkies and I witnessed Evelyn absolutely nailing a cartwheel on the street. Overall 10/10 would do again
        </p>
        <p> Btw. turns out my "upset stomach" was actually food poisoning from the salmon we had at the group dinner, as 3 other girls fells absolutely ill as well.</p>  
        <p> My next first was finally going to pride (yippee) I haven't gone before because no one really wanted to go with me :/ since my hometown friends don't like to go out, so it was a fun refresher. I went with a group of girls from the program 
          and I had been looking forward to it since Paris Pride is supposed to be lit. AND. IT. WAS. I got to see drag queens on 4x4 trucks blasting house and Lady Gaga. We walked the last leg with the parade 
          and made it to the end before crashing out back at the hotel. It was so so hot and muggy though and I got mosquito bites ALL over my leg--they are seriously homophobic. It felt so freeing being there and it will definitely not be my last!

        <h4>Lost in Bordeaux</h4>
        <div class="post-excerpt">
          <p>My first trip away from Paris fr fr. I went with the internship program and it was lit af. Wine country of course so I got to indulge, legally, in some classics of the area...</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-full-content" style="display: none;">
          <p>My first trip away from Paris fr fr. I went with the internship program and it was lit af. Wine country of course so I got to indulge, legally, in some classics of the area.
            At first, we got there at like 11pm at night and I was tired af but also very very hungry. Turns out one of the girls that I didn't know so well but went out once with was my roommate so we got gyros
            at a random open late place because even McDonalds was closed. Turns out we were not in the safest part of Bordeaux and we had to walk through some sketchy places--luckily Berkeley has prepared me lol.
            The next day we had a walking tour to attend and before that me and my roommate and some other girls visited the cathedral in Downtown and went shopping through some streets. It was the summer solstice aka Fête de la Musique 
            day, so all the shopowners were preparing for it by setting up DJ booths and tables outside.
          </p>
          <p> We went on a walking tour while it was so so hot though and now I feel burnt to oblivion. We saw and learned all the major history of the city, and it was supposed to end with wine and cheese, but since the internship is a dry program (for their activities), we had a scrumptious plate of cheese.</p>
        <p> The other night was of course Fête de la Musique, which was pretty fun but it deserves its own blog post. The next day, I went solo questing around because instead of the included lunch, I wanted to explore the city. I visited a nice museum and gardens and shopped for a bit.</p>
      <p> The craziest part of the trip was actually getting back--believe it or not. Our train got cancelled due to mechanical issues and there was no AC or wifi and my phone was about to die. I was also all alone in my train car lol. Since we were all separated, half of the group was told that they should board another train inbound to Paris, 
        but the other half (including myself and the group leaders) were not told this because we were in the last cars. So, we literally saw half the group leave without us. AND THIS WAS IN A HEAT WAVE!! So we had to sit around the hot, muggy train station for another 2 hours and then they emergency cleaned and made us board another train.
        When we finally got back it was like 11pm, and I still had Cal homework to do for the summer class, but I was hungry af and I thought I would treat myself with UberEats...TURNS OUT I ORDERED FOR PICK UP. So imagine me walking 10 minutes at midnight, tired and starving without my homework being started (it was due in a few hours)
        all to get a mid burger. Ultimately, your girl ate and locked in and completed all her stuff and finally got a few hours to sleep before my 7:30am wake up for my internship.
      </p>  
      <p> but at least i survived.</p>
